# Welcome

Enthusiasts of open technology unite! We are interested in Open Source, Open Data, Open Hardware, Makers and Makerspaces, and all that good, sharing vibe in technology!

We host talks and socials centred around open technologies and practices, and we'd like you to join us to share your experiences and knowledge! From hobbyists and newcomers to seasoned professionals, all are welcome.

Our aim is to host talks and lightning talks around open tech practices in industry and education, from members of our community on a regular basis.

* Every three months, the event will centre around one or two full-length talks.
* Other months, the diary will be open to anybody who would like to give a 5-10min lightning talk.
* We may determine full-length talks either
    * from the talk suggestions inbox
    * or invite lightning-talk speakers to expand on their topic, should they wish to
