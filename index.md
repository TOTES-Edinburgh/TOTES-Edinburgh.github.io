# Welcome

Enthusiasts of open technology unite! We are interested in Open Source, Open Data, Open Hardware, Makers and Makerspaces, and all that good, sharing vibe in technology!

We host talks and socials centred around open technologies and practices, and we'd like you to join us to share your experiences and knowledge! From hobbyists and newcomers to seasoned professionals, all are welcome.

Our aim is to host talks and lightning talks around open tech practices in industry and education, from members of our community on a regular basis.


## Events

Find us on [Meetup.com][meetup-url]

We are inviting everybody to talk and hear talks around Open Source, hosted in the heart of Edinburgh.

We aim to meet on the third Wednesday of each month, at Codebase, Edinburgh , followed by socialising in a nearby pub after the talks.


### Format

Currently, we aim to host a monthly event. We host three types of event:

* Talk events with one or two speakers on topics in open technologies and topics
* Open community BarCamp-style events
* Ask-Me-Anything ("AMA") events with a small panel of topic specialists

We do not host an event in August due to the local Edinburgh Festival and Fringe Festival events taking voer the town. Go see some arts!
