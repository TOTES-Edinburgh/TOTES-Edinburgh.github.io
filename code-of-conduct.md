# TOTES Code of Conduct

The Open Tech Edinburgh Scene group (TOTES) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the TOTES organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs; deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any TOTES event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are **expected to comply immediately**.

If a community member engages in harassing behaviour, the TOTES organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, asking the offender to leave the discussion or event, expulsion from the TOTES community, and/or removal from an event, without refund in cases of paid-for events.

All TOTES community members, organisers, guests and sponsors will be expected to adhere to this code of conduct when engaged with activities and events related to TOTES, including in online communications, in-person communication, presentation materials and in any materials and designs brought to a TOTES event.

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a [TOTES organiser][totes-leaders-url] immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.**

If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct [please contact the organisers][totes-leaders-url].
